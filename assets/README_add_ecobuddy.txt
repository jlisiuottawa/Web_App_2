Place the provided ecobuddy PNG in the path /assets/ecobuddy.png so the mascot image can load. The original PNG provided in the design should be named exactly "ecobuddy.png" and placed in the repository under the assets/ directory.

Path: assets/ecobuddy.png

If you want me to push the actual PNG binary into the repo, reply and I will add it in a follow-up commit.
